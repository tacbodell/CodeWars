## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript

The first thing I do every day is solve a CodeWars problem!

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Every day I can look back and improve on previous solutions by cutting down on bulky code and reviewing my solutions against others' solutions. I often find that I missed a built-in method or object that I can call upon to make my solution more abstracted and streamlined.

## Lessons Learned:
Whenever I complete a solution, comparing against the other possible solutions is always a goldmine of learning opportunities. This exercise has taught me how to optimize the efficiency and readability of my code, as well as how to develop solutions to complex problems that require compartmentalization of information into smaller, more digestible chunks.
